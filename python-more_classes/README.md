# Project Title: Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on deepening the understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, covering more advanced topics such as class methods, static methods, properties, and distinguishing between instance and class attributes through the development of a `Rectangle` class.

## Learning Objectives
- Mastery of Python programming and its OOP paradigm.
- Understanding of class and instance attributes, methods, and special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`.
- Practical application of data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Implementation of class methods and static methods.

## Technologies
- Language: Python 3.8.5
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Style guidelines: PEP 8

## Features
1. **0-simple_rectangle.py** - An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.
2. **1-rectangle.py** - A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by its width and height.
3. **2-rectangle.py** - Addition of area and perimeter methods to the Rectangle class.
4. **3-rectangle.py** - String representation of the Rectangle class.
5. **4-rectangle.py** - Implementing the `__repr__` method for the Rectangle class.
6. **5-rectangle.py** - Custom message for instance deletion of the Rectangle class.
7. **6-rectangle.py** - Tracking the number of instances of the Rectangle class.
8. **7-rectangle.py** - Modifiable string representation symbol for the Rectangle class.
9. **8-rectangle.py** - Static method to compare the area of two rectangles.
10. **9-rectangle.py** - Class method to create a square instance of the Rectangle class.
