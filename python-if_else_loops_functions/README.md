# Python Practice Tasks

This repository contains a collection of Python programming tasks and challenges. Each task is designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills.

## Task 0: Positive or Negative Number

- This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
- It prints whether the number stored in the variable is positive, negative, or zero.

## Task 1: The Last Digit

- This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
- It prints the last digit of the number and provides additional information based on the last digit.

## Task 2: Print ASCII Alphabet

- This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without a newline.
- It uses a single print function and a loop to achieve this.

## Task 3: Print ASCII Alphabet (Excluding 'q' and 'e')

- This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e.'
- It uses a single print function and a loop to achieve this.

## Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing

- This program prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
- It uses a single print function and a loop to achieve this.

## Task 5: Print Numbers Separated by Space

- This program prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by commas and spaces.
- Numbers are printed in ascending order with two digits.
- It uses no more than 2 print functions and a single loop.

## Task 6: Combinations of Two Digits

- This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- The combinations are separated by commas and spaces.
- It prints the smallest combination of two digits.

## Task 7: Check for Lowercase Character

- This function `islower(c)` checks if a character is lowercase.
- It returns `True` if the character is lowercase and `False` otherwise.
- It uses the `ord()` function to compare the character's Unicode code point.

## Task 8: Print in Uppercase

- This function `uppercase(str)` prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
- It uses no more than 2 print functions and a loop.
- It does not import any modules and does not use `str.upper()`.

## Task 9: Print Last Digit

- This function `print_last_digit(number)` prints the last digit of a number.
- It also returns the value of the last digit.
- It does not import any modules.

## Task 10: Add Two Integers

- This function `add(a, b)` adds two integers and returns the result.
- It does not import any modules.

## Task 11: Compute Power

- This function `pow(a, b)` computes the result of \(a^b\) and returns the value.
- It does not import any modules.

## Task 12: FizzBuzz

- This function `fizzbuzz()` prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific rules:
  - For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz."
  - For multiples of five, it prints "Buzz."
  - For multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz."

These tasks cover a range of Python programming concepts and challenges and are designed to help you practice and improve your coding skills.
