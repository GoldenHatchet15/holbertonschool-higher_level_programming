## Description

This project focuses on understanding and handling exceptions in Python. It covers various aspects of exceptions, including their purpose, how to raise them, and how to handle them properly in different scenarios.

## Resources

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Learn the difference between errors and exceptions.
- Understand what exceptions are and how to use them.
- Know when to use exceptions.
- Learn how to correctly handle an exception.
- Understand the purpose of catching exceptions.
- Learn how to raise a builtin exception.
- Understand when to implement a clean-up action after an exception.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Safe list printing
Write a function that prints `x` elements of a list.
- Prototype: `def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0)`
- `my_list` can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
- `x` represents the number of elements to print
- `x` can be bigger than the length of `my_list`
- Returns the real number of elements printed
- You have to use `try` / `except`
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use `len()`
- File: `0-safe_print_list.py`

### 1. Safe printing of an integers list
Write a function that prints an integer with `"{:d}".format()`.
- Prototype: `def safe_print_integer(value)`
- `value` can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
- The integer should be printed followed by a new line
- Returns `True` if `value` has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
- Otherwise, returns `False`
- You have to use `try` / `except`
- You have to use `"{:d}".format()` to print as integer
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use `type()`
- File: `1-safe_print_integer.py`

### ... (All other tasks follow a similar format)

## Usage

Each script can be run in a terminal using Python3. For example:

```bash
./0-safe_print_list.py
