# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary Project

## Description

This project is focused on understanding and implementing various data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries. It also covers the concepts of lambda, map, filter, and reduce functions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Learn and implement sets and their common methods.
- Differentiate when to use sets versus lists.
- Iterate through sets.
- Learn and implement dictionaries and their common methods.
- Differentiate when to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
- Understand the concept of a key in a dictionary.
- Iterate through a dictionary.
- Understand and implement lambda functions.
- Implement map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
